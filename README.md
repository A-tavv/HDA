# HDA (Bone age prediction from hand radiographs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance in various applications,
particularly in the field of medical imaging. A notable application gaining attention is bone age prediction, which involves
predicting bone development based on radiography images. In
this project, we implemented and evaluated multiple CNN-based
architectures, namely MobileNet, Inception V3, and Xception.
The crucial aspect of any deep learning project lies in the selection of hyperparameters. To address this, we employed Keras
Tuner for optimal parameter selection. Our best-performing
model, Xception 1, achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of
9.79, followed by Inception V3 with 12.04, and Xception 2 with
12.48
